                    <p>Assalamu Alaikum/Adab,<br>Through the ages enlightened people have come and shed light 
				    on the flowing lifestyle. Today we need enlightened people to 
				    build a peaceful and prosperous country by eliminating the 
				    various degradations of the present society. Needless to say, 
				    educational institutions are factories for making such creative 
				    people. Therefore, realizing the need to create creative and 
				    enlightened people, in 1995, motivated by the request and 
				    inspiration of prominent people of the area, I took the 
				    initiative to establish a college for the expansion of higher 
				    education at 16 No.Rupsa. My birth place is union under 
				    Faridganj upazila of Chandpur district. Initially the college 
				    started as Girdkalindiya High School and College but since 1997 
				    it was renamed as Girdkalindiya Hazera Hasmat College after my 
				    heavenly parents and now it is established as a full fledged 
				    university college.<br>I believe that Girdkalindiya Hazera Hasmat 
				    University College will become a unique and exemplary school 
				    and its students will play a unique role in building a prosperous 
				    country and a developed nation if everyone's cooperation and 
				    cooperation continues in the future as in the past. The light 
				    of knowledge is not only in Chandpur district but all over 
				    Bangladesh.<br>Dr. Mohammad Shamchul Haque Bhuiyan Former MP.<br>Founder
